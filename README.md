# MultiAgentSystem_Lab_III
This is the third lab in the series of 3 lab projects designed to introduce Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) as a base for Machine Learning. Note that these series do not feature any Machine Learning, only MAS. I completed these labs in my OO Programming, Data Structures, and Algorithms class.
