# MultiAgentSystem_Lab_III
This is the third lab in the series of 3 lab projects designed to introduce Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) as a base for Machine Learning. Note that these series do not feature any Machine Learning, only MAS and some basic strategy adjustment based on communication between agents. I completed these labs in my OO Programming, Data Structures, and Algorithms class.

Here is a short description of what exactly this program does:

 ## PART 1: part1.java
This program gives users the menu option to create 4 different types of networks:

* Two of the networks are borrowed from predefined examples by Albert-László Barabási in http://networksciencebook.com/chapter/3#number-of-links

* The third network lets the user pick a number of nodes and the probability of connection between any two nodes

* The last network takes the shape of a lattice, where each node has exactly 4 connections


 
All networks are written to a respective text file in the following format:

       1 3 // 1 and 3 connected
      
       1 5 //1 and 5 connected
       
       ...
       
       4 -1 //4 is not connected to anything
